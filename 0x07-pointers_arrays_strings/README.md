# 0x07 - Pointers, Arrays & Strings

WinMingle Community — Low Level Programming

This project covers advanced concepts in C relating to pointer-to-pointer usage, 
multidimensional arrays, and re-implementing common C standard library functions.  
All code is written following strict C89/gnu89 compilation rules.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What pointers to pointers are and how to use them
- How multidimensional arrays are stored in memory
- How to use and traverse 2D arrays
- How to re-implement standard string-manipulation routines
- Variable scope in pointer and array operations

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using:
- No global variables
- Max **5 functions per file**
- No standard library printing inside project functions  
(You may use stdio ONLY in your main.c test files)
- `_putchar` is allowed
- All prototypes must appear in **main.h**

## Tasks Overview

1. `_memset` – fill memory with constant byte  
2. `_memcpy` – copy memory area  
3. `_strchr` – locate character in string  
4. `_strspn` – get prefix substring length  
5. `_strpbrk` – search a string for a set of bytes  
6. `_strstr` – locate substring  
7. `print_chessboard` – print 8×8 board  
8. `print_diagsums` – sum square matrix diagonals  
9. `set_string` – pointer-to-pointer assignment  

Each task includes its own implementation and corresponding function prototype.
