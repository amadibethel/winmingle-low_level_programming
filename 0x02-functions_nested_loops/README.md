# WinMingle Software Engineering Training  
## Project: Functions & Nested Loops  

### 👨‍🏫 Instructor
**Greenfield Adolphus**

---

### 🧾 Overview
This project explores **functions**, **loops**, and **conditional logic** in C programming.  
You will learn how to break code into reusable components, manage flow control, and produce output using `_putchar` without relying on the standard library I/O functions.

By the end of this project, you should understand how to:
- Write and use functions
- Use nested loops efficiently
- Work with ASCII values and characters
- Implement conditional logic
- Manage C variable scope
- Build structured programs under compilation constraints
