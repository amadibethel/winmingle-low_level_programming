# WinMingle Software Engineering Training  
## Project: Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

### 📘 Overview
This project focuses on mastering **pointers**, **arrays**, and **strings** in C programming.  
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain these concepts clearly and implement them confidently in C programs without using the standard library I/O functions (`printf`, `puts`, etc.), except for `_putchar`.
